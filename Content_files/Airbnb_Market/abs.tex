For many destination resort towns, wintertime precipitation drives their economy and acts as a major export good. This study explores one gap in the climate change literature by providing new estimates for local and regional economic damages due to projected changes in snowpack for mountain resort economies across the United States. Building off a unique dataset of daily Airbnb reservations in 137 ski resort towns over three ski seasons, we combine daily weather (PRISM), daily resort snowfall, and daily resort snowpack to estimate the economic value of an inch of snow. We employ a rich set of panel fixed effects and estimate the snowpack elasticity of revenue to be between 0.07 and 0.12. Moreover, for a 10% decrease in snowpack, our estimates suggest a .7% to 1.2% decrease in average daily revenues. On average, this corresponds to a daily estimated $26k per inch of snow at the average resorts average snowpack. Under future climate scenarios, it is projected that U.S. ski resorts will see a 30% reduction in annual snowpack. When we impose a 30% reduction in daily snowpack to derive resort specific estimates for changes in Airbnb revenues, we find that states such as Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and California will experience losses of between $4-$6 million dollars per resort day.
